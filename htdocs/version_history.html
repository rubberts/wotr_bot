								<h1>War of the Ring Bot</h1>
								<h2>Version 1.3</h2>
								<ul>
									<li>Bonus benefit, being web app can use Google Translate to play in almost any language!</li>
									<li>Updated wording to "Holding a card with a playable character symbol?" or "Holding a card with a playable army or muster symbol?".</li>
									<li>Updated some missing tooltips.</li>
									<li>Added images of hunt pool where appropriate</li>
								</ul>
								<h2>Version 1.2</h2>
								<ul>
									<li>Added Image to show if bot strategy mode - corruption (ring on map) or military (facing armies)</li>
									<li>Added images of rings and dice where appropriate</li>
									<li>When the player has to do something, stop and have them click DONE.</li>
									<li>Fixed some bugs with flow logic</li>
									<li>Added tooltips for key words in glossary of terms.</li>
									<li>Fixed issue with apostrophies in tooltips.</li>
									<li>Expanded on discard priority list wording.</li>
									<li>Increased the contrast on the buttons to make more accessible.</li>
								</ul>
								<h2>Version 1.1</h2>
								<ul>
									<li>Made the action words into buttons so they're easier to hit on mobile devices.</li>
									<li>Added question marks to the end of questions.</li>
								</ul>
								<h2>TODO</h2>
								<ul>
									<li>Add some padding to the bottom option so it isn't right up against the bottom of the browser.
	On my iPhone I couldn't select the "No" option of Phase 1, it was blocked by the address bar. Options thereafter are fine.</li>
									<li>Allow user to go back up the tree to undo mistakes (fat fingers).</li>
									<li>Consider leaving the selected responses on the screen. Unsure on that.</li>
									<li>As an app you could allow a user to select whether they want WoME content or not and then include/exclude it.
	Option to include/exclude WoME content</li>
									<li>Needs some way to bring up the general rules. Ideally this would be a smart implementation that brings up rules specific to the current instruction, but for starters just having a way to display them would be good.</li>
								</ul>
								<h2>UNABLE TO REPLICATE</h2>
								<ul>
									<li>@csteinberg - Error in flow: asked if there was a Nazgul on the fellowship (there wasn't) and instead of recommending I move one the app said attack... The flow charts in the file above recommended moving.</li>
								</ul>
