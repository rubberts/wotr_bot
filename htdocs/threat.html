               <p>The first thing the bot always does when choosing what die to use is check for threat. It finds itself
starting a new turn with the game state displayed above.
The first thing to do is to identify all Shadow strongholds with Free Peoples’ armies within two regions.
From top to bottom:
• Mount Gundabad – the North in Carrock
• Moria – the Elves in Dimrill Dale
• Dol Guldur – the Elves in Dimrill Dale
• Orthanc – Rohan in the Fords of Isen and Helm’s Deep
• Umbar – Gondor in Pelargir and Osgiliath
Next, we ignore all Free Peoples’ nations which are not active, meaning Mount Gundabad and Orthanc
are safe.
Then we discount all armies currently located on a target. This means Umbar is safe from Pelargir, but
not Osgiliath.
Finally, we calculate the defender values remembering to include the stronghold bonus where
appropriate:
• Moria – 6
• Dol Guldur – 0
• Umbar – 9
Now we calculate the value of the armies within range, and we exclude defensive bonuses since we’re
considering them as attackers:
• Dimrill Dale – 9
• Osgiliath – 4
Umbar is safe, but there is a threat to Moira and Dol Guldur from the Dimrill Dale and the bot would
follow the threat part of its phase 5 flowchart.
This may seem like a lot of work, but no stronghold starts the game under threat, so it will become
obvious when the situation changes. The only time you may need to perform a full board check is
when the Witch King enters play and multiple nations become active at once</p>
