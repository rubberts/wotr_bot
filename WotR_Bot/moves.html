                  <p>“Consider both moves when evaluating true/false and priorities for an army die. If two moves
combined can meet a condition, then the condition is true.”
But what does this mean?
In this instance, meeting the condition requires only a single army move, rolling a die to determine
which army moves. Restart the flowchart to find the second army move.
If the army die still has both moves available then the condition above is true, as both armies can
move into East Rhûn. If other army merges were possible they would be considered in accordance
with the priority list, whether one or two army moves is required does not impact the priority of the
action unless it’s specifically included on the priority list.</p>
